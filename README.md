# Patient Readmission Prediction (Diabetes)
Final project of the course "Introduction to Data Science" in the academic year 2024/2025 at the University of Stavanger.

## Project Goal
The main goal of this project is to analyze the "Diabetes 130-US Hospitals for Years 1999-2008" dataset and apply machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine to predict whether a diabetes patient will be rehospitalized within 30 days of discharge.
